                        The Sri Veeranjaneyaswamy Temple at Garukamanthanaplaya (G.M.Palya) traces its roots back to the 15th century. It is believed that the temple was established by the great saint Sri Vyasaraja, the pre-incarnation of Sri Raghavendra Swamy, during his spiritual mission across India. Renowned for installing 732 idols of Lord Anjaneya, Sri Vyasaraja consecrated this temple to invoke Vayu (Hanuman) and to alleviate the sufferings of the world. A unique feature of the idol here is its distinct posture — the right hand raised toward the sky or the devotees (known as Abhaya Hastha), a Gadha held in the other hand, the tail coiled above the head in a crescent shape with a bell at the tip, and the presence of Sri Ram Beejakshara. It is said that with the support of villagers, the idol was installed and the temple came to life.

                        <h4>Jeernoddhara of the Temple and Divine Revival</h4>
                        <p>In the early 1900s, a weaver named Mr. Giriyappa from Cottonpet, Bengaluru, visited the ancient shrine of Sri Veeranjaneyaswamy during his travels for his sari business. While resting at the temple, he experienced a divine vision in which Lord Veeranjaneya appeared in a dream and urged him to restore the sacred place, promising him blessings in the form of a male child.
                            Moved by this divine experience, Mr. Giriyappa sought the cooperation of the local villagers and, with their support, constructed a small shrine around the existing idol. In time, he was blessed with a son, Mr. Anjanappa, whom he believed to be the fruit of the Lord’s blessings.
                            </p><br><p>Later, in 1944, Mr. Anjanappa took the initiative to further develop the temple. He mobilized support from the villagers and sourced construction materials such as rocks and pillars from Sharabande, near Banashankari, Bengaluru. With the help of farmers and their bullock carts, stones, slabs, and wooden beams were transported to the site for reconstruction.
                            On May 13, 1945, with the united efforts of Mr. Anjanappa, local farmers, and skilled artisans, the temple was successfully renovated and consecrated.
                            </p><br><p>The Trust gratefully acknowledges the generosity of the land donors whose contributions were vital to the temple’s development:

                        <p>In 2008, the Sri Veeranjaneyaswamy Educational and Charitable Trust, with support from the villagers, began the sacred search for a monolithic stone (Ekashila) to sculpt the idol of Sri Veeranjaneya Swamy. 
                            Guided by architect Sri Kashinath, and inspired by visits to temples in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, a divine stone was identified in Koira, Devanahalli Taluk. Measuring 40 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 9 feet thick, the 240-ton rock was choosen as the sacred base for the idol.</p>

                            The stone finally arrived on 26th January 2009, marking a historic moment.

                            </p><p>Following this, renowned national award sculptor Sri Ashoka Gudigar was entrusted by the Trust and villagers to carve the divine Ekashila idol of Sri Veeranjaneya Swamy, a task he humbly accepted.
                                 As per architectural design, the existing shrines of Lord Ganesha, Sri Subramanya, and Navagrahas were relocated and beautifully reconstructed, enhancing the spiritual and architectural sanctity of the temple.</p>

                        <p>In 2017, as part of the temple development and proper realignment, the shrines of Sri Ganesha, Sri Subramanya, Sri Nagadevatha, and Sri Navagraha were relocated and newly constructed within the temple premises. These temples were shifted to new locations following Vastu guidelines to enhance spiritual harmony. Notably, the Navagraha temple was relocated and constructed on the northern side of the Sri Maheshwaramma Temple, directly opposite the Ekashila idol.

                            </p><p>Alongside these developments, Vimana Gopuras were constructed and consecrated for both the Sri Veeranjaneya Swamy Temple and the Sri Maheshwaramma Temple. These towering, designed structures added majestic presence to the temples. The Kumbabhisheka ceremonies for both gopuras were performed with great devotion and grandeur during the 2017 Mahotsava celebrations, enhancing the spiritual aura and architectural magnificence of the temple complex.</p>

                            </p><br><p>Another significant development was the construction of a dedicated Homa Mantapa, designed to accommodate rituals such as homas and havans performed by families and smaller groups of devotees. This serene and functional space provides an ideal setting for personal offerings, prayers, and spiritual gatherings.
