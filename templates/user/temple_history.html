                        The Sri Veeranjaneyaswamy Temple at Garukamanthanapally (G.M.Palya) traces its roots back to the 15th century. It is believed that the temple was established by the great saint Sri Vyasaraja, the pre-incarnation of Sri Raghavendra Swami, during his spiritual mission across India. Renowned for installing 732 idols of Lord Anjaneya, Sri Vyasaraja consecrated this temple to invoke Vayu (Hanuman) and to alleviate the sufferings of the world. A unique feature of the idol here is its distinct posture — the right hand raised toward the sky or the devotees (known as Abhaya Hastha), a Gadha held in the other hand, the tail coiled above the head in a crescent shape with a bell at the tip, and the presence of Sri Ram Beejakshara. It is said that with the support of villagers, the idol was installed and the temple came to life.

                        <p>In 1945, Mr. Giriyappa, a weaver from the village and father of Mr. Anjanappa, visited the temple while traveling for his sari business. During his rest at the temple, he had a divine dream in which Sri Veeranjaneyaswamy appeared and urged him to restore the temple, promising blessings for his family. Inspired by the vision, Mr. Giriyappa sought help from villagers in Sharabande near Banashankari, Bangalore. Using bullock carts, they transported stones, pillars, and roofing slabs needed for the renovation. On May 13, 1945, Mr. Anjanappa of Shiryada, with the support of local farmers and skilled workers, successfully renovated and rebuilt the temple.</p>

                        <p>On 11th September 1995, with the united support and devotion of the villagers, an organization named Sri Veeranjaneyaswamy Educational and Charitable Trust was established. This sacred trust was founded with the noble intention of serving the temple and the community without any discrimination or involvement in politics. Since its inception, the trust has been actively engaged in the spiritual and structural development of the temple. Every year, it conducts Hanuma Jayanti celebrations with great devotion, including the auspicious Pavamana Homa, and generously distributes free prasadam (annadhanam)—especially rice offerings—to villagers and neighboring communities, upholding the values of service and devotion.</p>

                        <p>In April 2004, a grand 68-feet high Rajagopura was consecrated by the amrita hasta (divine hand) of Sri Sushameendra Teertha Swamiji, the revered pontiff of Sri Raghavendra Swamy Matha, Mantralaya. This divine occasion marked a significant milestone in the spiritual and architectural evolution of the temple.
                            </p><p>On behalf of the Sri Veeranjaneyaswamy Educational and Charitable Trust, the need for constructing the Rajagopura was put forth, emphasizing its alignment with Vastu Shastra and the sacred traditions of temple architecture. As part of these changes, the old well behind the sanctum sanctorum was respectfully closed, and residents within the temple premises were instructed to vacate, allowing the temple grounds to be restructured in accordance with scriptural guidelines.</p>

                        <p>In 2008, the Sri Veeranjaneyaswamy Educational and Charitable Trust, with support from the villagers, began the sacred search for a monolithic stone (Ekashila) to sculpt the idol of Sri Veeranjaneya Swamy. Guided by architect Sri Kashinath, and inspired by visits to temples in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, a divine stone was identified in Koira, Devanahalli Taluk. Measuring 40 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 9 feet thick, the 240-ton rock was chosen as the sacred base for the idol.</p>

                            </p><p>Following this, renowned Vastu sculptor Sri Ashoka Gudigar was entrusted by the Trust and villagers to carve the divine Ekashila idol of Sri Veeranjaneya Swamy, a task he humbly accepted, promising completion within three years. As per Vastu Shastra, the existing shrines of Lord Ganesha, Sri Subramanya, and Navagrahas were relocated and beautifully reconstructed, enhancing the spiritual and architectural sanctity of the temple.</p>

                        <p>In 2017, as part of the temple development and Vastu realignment, the shrines of Sri Ganesha, Sri Subramanya, Sri Nagadevatha, and Sri Navagraha were relocated and newly constructed within the temple premises. These temples were shifted to new locations following Vastu guidelines to enhance spiritual harmony. Notably, the Navagraha temple was relocated and constructed on the northern side of the Sri Maheshwaramma Temple, directly opposite the Ekashila idol.

                            </p><p>Alongside these developments, Vimana Gopuras were constructed and consecrated for both the Sri Veeranjaneya Swamy Temple and the Sri Maheshwaramma Temple. These towering, ornately designed structures added majestic presence to the temples. The Kumbabhisheka ceremonies for both gopuras were performed with great devotion and grandeur during the 2017 Mahotsava celebrations, enhancing the spiritual aura and architectural magnificence of the temple complex.</p>
